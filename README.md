**Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program**

Project 2. Portfolio site

## Description

This was my second project for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer nanodegree program. Students were provided with a design mockup (screenshot) of a developer portfolio webpage, and had to replicate the design with HTML and CSS.

<img src="docs/img/design-mockup-portfolio-thumbnail-square.png" alt="Portfolio website mockup">

I based the webpage on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) v4.0.0. In the main webpage _index.html_, I linked to the Bootstrap core CSS through their Content Delivery Network (CDN). I also included [Prism syntax highlighting](http://prismjs.com/) CSS and JavaScript files, and _portfolio.css_ for additional custom styling.

I provided a toggle button in the navigation menu that uses jQuery JavaScript to change the page color scheme.

I used the webpage design to create a full website with Jekyll, and hosted the site with GitHub Pages. The website includes a homepage, an "About" page where I introduce myself and my Udacity work, a "Methods" page explaining how I built the site in detail, a "Rubric" page providing the Udacity project documentation, and a "Review" page documenting the Udacity code review.
